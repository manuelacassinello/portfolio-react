          <h1>La Caldera is an artistic center characterized by being a center for artistic creation that encourages experimentation to express one’s essence, as can be seen in the variety of shows and activities. The rooms of La Caldera are old movie theaters.
            The characteristic doors with a round window allows you to see what is inside.</h1>
          <h2>The concept for this new corporate image comes from the concept of the windows that exist throughout the installation, those round windows located in the center of the doors of
            all rooms lets you see what happens inside. The concept of the window allowed us to represent the introspection of the artist, the organic and dynamic forms of dance, to seek complexity in everyday life.</h2>
          <h3>From an intuitive interactive website, the resident artists and collaborators of La Caldera will generate the center’s own identity. The website allows a free choice of both
            shape and filling, whether textures generated with Processing or a series of corporate fixed colors.</h3>
