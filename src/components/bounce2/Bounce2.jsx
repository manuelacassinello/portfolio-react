            <h1>This project we explore new ways of understanding and creating culture from an
              embodied perspective, to develop our
              understanding of culture to re-frame it and
              re-design it by taking self-experience as
              a starting point.</h1>

            <h2>These were some questions that we
              proposed for this project: How would it
              be to experience culture on our bodies?
              How culture can be transformed, experienced, and shared by others in the form of
              embodied interactions?
            </h2>

            <h3>Bounce is the creation of prototypes to be experienced on the body with
              the objective of understanding culture
              from your personal experience, trans-
              forming culture with your bodies as a
              starting point through an interactive
              prototype.</h3>


            <h4>    In the process of brainstorming we took into account two concepts
              that perfectly described our culture:
              the unpredictability and the expansion
              of things. These two concepts descrive
              the sea. These two dresses are a clear
              portrait of the concepts already
              explained. They transport to the city the
              simulation of the bounce that can arise
              in an unpredictable way in the sea.
            </h4>

              This project is the reinterpretation of the echo phenomenon that we
              see when a movement is made in the sea
              fashioned into a dress.</h5>
