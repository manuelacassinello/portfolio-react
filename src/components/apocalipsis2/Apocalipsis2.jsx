          <h1>The theme of this photographic novel is based on the reinterpretation of the chapter
            of the seven trumpets of the apocalypse, which is applied to the seven most crucial
            problems of the 21st century. The issues we chose are: war technologies, borders,
            lack of resources, vice, stereotypes, nature and faith. The choice of these
            themes was premeditated and related to the scenes of the Apocalypse according to
            Saint John.</h1>

          <h2>These were some questions that we
            proposed for this project: How would it
            be to experience culture on our bodies?
            How culture can be transformed, experienced, and shared by others in the form of
            embodied interactions?
          </h2>

          <h3>Bounce is the creation of prototypes to be experienced on the body with
            the objective of understanding culture
            from your personal experience, trans-
            forming culture with your bodies as a
            starting point through an interactive
            prototype.</h3>


          <h4>    In the process of brainstorming we took into account two concepts
            that perfectly described our culture:
            the unpredictability and the expansion
            of things. These two concepts descrive
            the sea. These two dresses are a clear
            portrait of the concepts already
            explained. They transport to the city the
            simulation of the bounce that can arise
            in an unpredictable way in the sea.

            This project is the reinterpretation of the echo phenomenon that we
            see when a movement is made in the sea
            fashioned into a dress.</h5>
