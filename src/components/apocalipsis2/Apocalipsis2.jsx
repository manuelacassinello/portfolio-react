            of the seven trumpets of the apocalypse, which is applied to the seven most crucial
            problems of the 21st century.</h1>

            lack of resources, vice, stereotypes, nature and faith. The choice of these
            themes was premeditated and related to the scenes of the Apocalypse according to
            Saint John. </h2>
